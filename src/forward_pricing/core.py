"""
Core formulas for equity index forwards/futures (continuous compounding).

We will implement these in Level 1â€“3:
  F_th = S0 * exp((r - q) * T)                # theoretical forward (equity, cont. dividend q)
  r*   = q + (1/T) * ln(F_mkt / S0)           # implied risk-free rate from observed forward
  q*   = r - (1/T) * ln(F_mkt / S0)           # implied dividend yield from observed forward

Notes:
- S0 > 0, T >= 0 (T in years; ACT/365 convention)
- r, q are annualized (continuous)
- For T very close to 0, guard against division by zero when computing implieds
